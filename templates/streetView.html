        Are you looking for a good little bump in power without
        having to make any huge physical modifications to your Subaru?
        Stage 1 generally consists of just an ECU reflash where boost
        pressure is raised. It’s common for this stage to also include
        an intake. Stage 1 can be achieved via Cobb’s Accessport or
        protune.

        The stock exhausts from Subaru can be fairly restrictive.
        This is where we enter the most common performance upgrade with
        Subarus. Stage 2 consists of replacing your stock exhaust with an
        aftermarket turboback 3-4" exhaust system. This will allow for a
        significant increase of airflow compared to the stock system.
        Along with the increase of power, your car will also be noticeably
        louder. Just like Stage 1, Stage 2 can be flashed via Cobb's Accessport
        or can be setup through a protune.
